Swan Lake (1877)**\nComposed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, this is arguably the most famous ballet ever created. The story of Odette, cursed to be a swan by day, has captivated audiences for over a century. Its iconic music, particularly the \"Dance of the Little Swans\" and Odette's solos, along with the demanding dual role of Odette/Odile, has made it a cornerstone of classical ballet repertoire worldwide.\n\n**2. The Nutcracker (1892)**\nAlso by Tchaikovsky, this ballet has become synonymous with the holiday season and serves as many people's introduction to ballet. The magical story of Clara and her Nutcracker Prince, combined with unforgettable music like the \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\" and \"Waltz of the Flowers,\" has made it the most performed ballet globally, especially during Christmas season.\n\n**3. Giselle (1841)**\nWith music by Adolphe Adam, this Romantic ballet tells the tragic story of a peasant girl who dies of heartbreak and returns as a spirit. It's considered one of the greatest achievements of Romantic ballet, featuring some of the most technically and emotionally demanding choreography, particularly in the famous \"Mad Scene\" and the ethereal Wili scenes in Act II.\n\nThese three ballets represent the pinnacle of classical ballet artistry and continue to be performed by major ballet companies worldwide."
