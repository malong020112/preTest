The user has explicitly stated they want to learn piano as a beginner and specifically requested a structured guide that includes online tutorials.\n\n**User's Goal Summary:** You want a comprehensive beginner's piano learning guide that includes online tutorial resources to help you start your piano journey.\n\nHere's a structured beginner's piano guide with online tutorials:\n\n**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)**\nStart with proper posture and hand positioning. Learn basic music theory including the musical alphabet (A-G), understanding the piano layout with white and black keys, and basic note values (whole, half, quarter notes). For online tutorials, YouTube channels like \"Piano Lessons On The Web\" and \"HDpiano\" offer excellent beginner fundamentals. Flowkey and Simply Piano apps provide interactive lessons perfect for absolute beginners.\n\n**Phase 2: Basic Skills (Weeks 5-12)**\nFocus on simple melodies using one hand, basic scales (C major scale), and simple chords (C, F, G major triads). Practice reading basic sheet music and learn finger numbering (1-5 for each hand). \"PianoForAll\" online course and \"Piano Nanny\" YouTube channel are excellent for this phase. Yousician also gamifies this learning stage effectively.\n\n**Phase 3: Coordination (Weeks 13-24)**\nBegin playing simple songs with both hands, practice basic chord progressions, and work on rhythm and timing. Start with easy pieces like \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" or \"Happy Birthday.\" \"Piano Video Lessons\" and \"PianoVideoLessons.com\" offer structured progression through popular songs.\n\n**Practice Schedule:** Aim for 15-30 minutes daily, focusing on technique over speed. Use a metronome (apps like \"Metronome Plus\" work well) and always warm up with scales before practicing pieces.\n\nThis structured approach will give you a solid foundation while keeping you motivated with recognizable songs and clear progress milestones."

The user is asking for the top 3 most renowned ballet performances of all time, which is a straightforward request for information about historically significant and acclaimed ballet works.\n\n**User's Task Summary:** Identify and provide information about the three most renowned/famous ballet performances in history.\n\nBased on historical significance, cultural impact, and enduring popularity, here are the top 3 most renowned ballet performances of all time:\n\n**1. Swan Lake (1877)**\nComposed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, this is arguably the most famous ballet ever created. The story of Odette, cursed to be a swan by day, has captivated audiences for over a century. Its iconic music, particularly the \"Dance of the Little Swans\" and Odette's solos, along with the demanding dual role of Odette/Odile, has made it a cornerstone of classical ballet repertoire worldwide.\n\n**2. The Nutcracker (1892)**\nAlso by Tchaikovsky, this ballet has become synonymous with the holiday season and serves as many people's introduction to ballet. The magical story of Clara and her Nutcracker Prince, combined with beloved musical pieces like the \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\" and \"Waltz of the Flowers,\" has made it the most performed ballet globally.\n\n**3. Giselle (1841)**\nWith music by Adolphe Adam, this Romantic-era ballet tells the tragic story of a peasant girl who dies of heartbreak and returns as a spirit. It's considered one of the greatest achievements of Romantic ballet, featuring some of the most challenging and expressive choreography in the classical repertoire, particularly in the famous \"Mad Scene\" and the ethereal second act.\n\nThese three ballets represent the pinnacle of classical ballet artistry and continue to be performed by major ballet companies worldwide."
