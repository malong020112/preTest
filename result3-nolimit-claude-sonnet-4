You want to learn piano as a beginner and are specifically requesting a structured guide that includes online tutorials.\n\n**Your Goal:** Learn to play piano from scratch with a structured beginner's approach that incorporates online tutorial resources.\n\nHere's a comprehensive beginner's piano guide:\n\n## Getting Started\nFirst, you'll need access to a piano or keyboard. A full 88-key digital piano is ideal, but a 61-key keyboard can work for beginners. Ensure it has weighted keys if possible, as this mimics the feel of an acoustic piano.\n\n## Structured Learning Path\n\n**Week 1-2: Fundamentals**\nStart with proper posture and hand positioning. Learn to identify middle C and understand the layout of black and white keys. Practice simple finger exercises to build dexterity.\n\n**Week 3-4: Basic Music Theory**\nLearn to read basic notation, understand the staff, treble clef, and note values (whole, half, quarter notes). Practice identifying notes on the keyboard.\n\n**Week 5-8: Simple Melodies**\nBegin playing simple songs with one hand, focusing on accuracy and rhythm. Gradually introduce both hands playing together with basic coordination exercises.\n\n**Month 2-3: Scales and Chords**\nLearn major scales starting with C major, then basic triads and simple chord progressions. Practice scales daily for finger strength and familiarity.\n\n## Recommended Online Tutorial Platforms\n\n**Simply Piano** - Interactive app that listens to your playing and provides feedback\n**Flowkey** - High-quality video lessons with popular songs\n**Piano Academy** - Comprehensive courses from beginner to advanced\n**YouTube channels:** PianoVideoLessons, Piano Lessons On The Web, and HDpiano offer excellent free content\n\n## Practice Schedule\nAim for 20-30 minutes daily rather than longer, infrequent sessions. Consistency is more valuable than duration for building muscle memory and technique.\n\nThis structured approach will give you a solid foundation while keeping you motivated with recognizable songs and steady progress."

The user is asking for the top 3 most renowned ballet performances of all time, which is a specific request for ballet works that are widely recognized as masterpieces in the ballet world.\n\n**Summary of User's Goal:** Identify the three most famous and acclaimed ballet performances in ballet history.\n\nHere are the top 3 most renowned ballet performances of all time:\n\n**1. Swan Lake (1877)**\nComposed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Swan Lake is arguably the most famous ballet ever created. The story of Odette, a princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer's curse, has captivated audiences for over a century. Its iconic music, including the \"Dance of the Little Swans\" and Odette's solo variations, along with the demanding dual role of Odette/Odile, has made it a cornerstone of classical ballet repertoire.\n\n**2. The Nutcracker (1892)**\nAlso by Tchaikovsky, The Nutcracker has become synonymous with ballet itself, especially during the holiday season. The ballet tells the story of young Clara and her magical Christmas Eve adventure. Its memorable score includes the famous \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\" and \"Waltz of the Flowers.\" The Nutcracker is often the first ballet many people experience and remains one of the most performed ballets worldwide.\n\n**3. Giselle (1841)**\nWith music by Adolphe Adam, Giselle is considered one of the greatest Romantic ballets. The story of a peasant girl who dies of heartbreak and returns as a spirit to save her beloved showcases the ethereal, otherworldly quality that defines Romantic ballet. The role of Giselle is considered one of the most challenging and prestigious in the ballet repertoire, requiring exceptional dramatic and technical skills.\n\nThese three ballets represent the pinnacle of classical ballet artistry and continue to be performed by major ballet companies around the world."
