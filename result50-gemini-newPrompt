The user has requested a default overview after being presented with more specific options.\n\nTask: Provide a general overview of the history and significance of Chinese New Year.\n\nHere is a summary covering the key aspects of Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival or Lunar New Year.\n\n### **Overview of Chinese New Year**\n\nChinese New Year is the most important festival in Chinese culture, marking the beginning of the traditional lunisolar calendar. It's a time for honoring deities and ancestors, feasting with family, and celebrating the start of a new year.\n\n#### **1. Mythological Origin: The Legend of Nian**\n\nThe celebration's origins are tied to the myth of a beast called **Nian (年)**.\n*   Nian would emerge on New Year's Eve to attack villagers, eat livestock, and harm children.\n*   Villagers discovered the beast was afraid of three things: the color red, loud noises, and fire.\n*   This led to the core traditions of pasting red paper decorations, lighting lanterns, and setting off firecrackers to scare the beast away. The character for \"year\" (年, nián) is the same as the beast's name.\n\n#### **2. Key Traditions and Their Significance**\n\nMany practices are designed to bid farewell to the old year and welcome luck and prosperity for the new one.\n\n*   **Family Reunion Dinner (年夜饭, niányèfàn):** This is the most important part of the celebration. Families travel long distances to gather for a grand feast on New Year's Eve, reinforcing family bonds.\n*   **Red Decorations:** Homes are decorated with red lanterns, red paper cuttings, and couplets (poetic verses) on doorways. Red symbolizes luck, joy, and prosperity.\n*   **Symbolic Foods:**\n    *   **Dumplings (饺子, jiǎozi):** Shaped like ancient Chinese gold ingots, they represent wealth.\n    *   **Fish (鱼, yú):** The word for fish sounds like the word for \"surplus\" or \"abundance.\" It's often served whole to represent family unity.\n    *   **Spring Rolls (春卷, chūnjuǎn):** Their golden, cylindrical shape resembles gold bars, symbolizing wealth.\n*   **Red Envelopes (红包, hóngbāo):** Married adults give red envelopes containing money to children and unmarried younger relatives. This tradition symbolizes the sharing of blessings and good fortune.\n\n#### **3. Modern-Day Significance**\n\nWhile ancient traditions are still central, the festival has evolved.\n*   It's a major global event celebrated by Chinese diaspora communities worldwide.\n*   It is one of the world's largest annual human migrations, as hundreds of millions of people travel home for family reunions.\n*   The focus remains on **family, renewal, and hope for a prosperous new year.**"

Mobile Apps (Free with optional paid features)\nThese are great for casual, on-the-go practice and finding partners quickly. They are best for both casual conversation and light structured practice.\n\n*   **HelloTalk:** The most popular app for language exchange. It features integrated tools for chat, voice/video calls, and text correction. You can find partners for casual chat or arrange more structured practice.\n*   **Tandem:** Similar to HelloTalk, Tandem connects you with native speakers for free via text, audio, and video chat. It also has an option to book paid lessons with professional tutors within the app.\n\n### 2. Tutoring Marketplaces (Free and Paid options)\nThese platforms are ideal if you want to find both free community partners and professional, paid tutors for structured lessons.\n\n*   **italki:** A versatile platform where you can find:\n    *   **Community Tutors:** For informal, paid conversation practice.\n    *   **Professional Teachers:** For structured, formal lessons.\n    *   **Language Partners:** A free community feature to find exchange partners for mutual practice.\n*   **Preply:** Primarily focused on connecting students with paid tutors for one-on-one lessons. It's an excellent choice if you decide you want a more formal, structured learning plan.\n\n### 3. Online Communities (Free)\nThese are less structured but can be great for finding dedicated partners if you're willing to put in a bit more effort.\n\n*   **Reddit:** The subreddit r/language_exchange is a very active community where users post looking for partners to practice with via Skype, Discord, WhatsApp, etc.\n*   **Discord:** Search for public language-learning servers. Many servers are dedicated to specific languages and have channels specifically for finding practice partners.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nFor a balanced start, I suggest creating a profile on **HelloTalk** or **Tandem**. This will immediately expose you to a large community for free, casual practice. If you find you need more structure, you can then explore the paid tutoring options on **italki**."

This report provides a high-level overview of its primary impacts.\n\n**1. Environmental Impacts**\nThe most direct consequences are environmental. Rising global temperatures are causing glaciers and ice sheets to melt, contributing to **sea-level rise** that threatens coastal communities. This warming also fuels more frequent and intense **extreme weather events**, including heatwaves, droughts, heavy rainfall, and more powerful hurricanes. Ecosystems are under severe stress, leading to **biodiversity loss** as species struggle to adapt, coral reefs bleach, and forests become more susceptible to wildfires.\n\n**2. Socio-Economic Effects**\nThese environmental shifts create significant socio-economic disruption. **Agriculture and food security** are at risk due to changing weather patterns, water scarcity, and decreased crop yields. Critical **infrastructure**—such as roads, bridges, and power grids—faces damage from extreme weather, leading to costly repairs. Economies are burdened by the costs of disaster recovery, adaptation measures, and disruptions to global supply chains. In some regions, resource scarcity and displacement can exacerbate social tensions.\n\n**3. Human Health Repercussions**\nHuman health is directly threatened. Increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves lead to a higher incidence of **heat-related illnesses** and deaths. Worsening air quality from wildfires and pollution can cause or aggravate **respiratory conditions**. Furthermore, changing climate patterns can expand the geographic range of disease vectors like mosquitoes and ticks, increasing the risk and spread of **infectious diseases** such as malaria and dengue fever."

You want to know the steps to diagnose and speed up your slow Windows computer.\n\nHere are the steps to diagnose and speed up your Windows PC, starting with the most common and effective solutions.\n\n### **Steps to Speed Up Your Windows Computer**\n\n**Step 1: Check for Resource-Hungry Programs**\nThis helps you find what's actively slowing down your PC right now.\n1.  Open **Task Manager** by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + Esc`.\n2.  Click \"More details\" if you see a simplified view.\n3.  In the \"Processes\" tab, click the **CPU**, **Memory**, and **Disk** column headers to sort by usage.\n4.  If any non-essential program is consistently using a high percentage (e.g., >80%) of your resources, consider closing it by selecting it and clicking \"End task\". Be cautious not to end critical system processes.\n\n**Step 2: Disable Unnecessary Startup Programs**\nThis improves your computer's boot time and frees up resources.\n1.  In **Task Manager**, go to the **\"Startup\"** tab.\n2.  Sort by the \"Startup impact\" column.\n3.  For any non-essential program with a \"High\" impact (e.g., Spotify, game launchers), right-click and select **\"Disable\"**.\n\n**Step 3: Free Up Disk Space**\nA nearly full drive, especially the one Windows is on (usually C:), can slow the system.\n1.  Open the Start Menu, type `Disk Cleanup`, and press Enter.\n2.  Select your `(C:)` drive.\n3.  The tool will calculate space you can free up. Check the boxes for files you want to delete (e.g., \"Temporary Internet Files,\" \"Recycle Bin\") and click **OK**.\n\n**Step 4: Scan for Malware**\nMalicious software can run in the background, consuming resources.\n1.  Open the Start Menu, type `Windows Security`, and press Enter.\n2.  Go to **\"Virus & threat protection\"**.\n3.  Click **\"Quick scan\"**. If you have time, run a \"Full scan\" for a more thorough check.\n\n**Step 5: Update Windows**\nUpdates often include performance improvements and security fixes.\n1.  Open the Start Menu, type `Check for updates`, and press Enter.\n2.  Click **\"Check for updates\"** and install any available ones.\n\nIf these steps don't resolve the issue, the slowness could be related to older hardware (like a slow hard disk drive or insufficient RAM), which might require a physical upgrade."

You want to diagnose and fix slowness specifically when playing video games on your Windows computer.\n\nHere are the steps to improve gaming performance on your Windows PC.\n\n### **Steps to Fix Slowdown in Video Games**\n\nGaming performance is heavily dependent on your graphics card (GPU) and processor (CPU). These steps focus on optimizing them for gaming.\n\n**Step 1: Update Your Graphics Drivers**\nThis is the single most important step for gaming performance. Outdated drivers are a very common cause of slow gameplay, stuttering, and crashes.\n\n1.  **Identify your graphics card:** If you don't know, press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open **Task Manager**, go to the **\"Performance\"** tab, and click on **\"GPU\"**. The name will be in the top-right corner (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070, AMD Radeon RX 6600).\n2.  **Download the latest drivers:**\n    *   **For NVIDIA:** Go to the NVIDIA Driver Downloads site.\n    *   **For AMD:** Go to the AMD Drivers and Support site.\n    *   **For Intel:** Go to the Intel Drivers & Software site.\n3.  Install the drivers and restart your computer.\n\n**Step 2: Adjust In-Game Settings**\nThe game's own settings have the biggest impact on performance.\n1.  Launch the game and go to its **Video/Graphics Settings**.\n2.  **Lower the Resolution:** If you're playing at 4K, try dropping to 1440p or 1080p. This provides a major performance boost.\n3.  **Lower the Graphics Quality Preset:** Change the preset from \"Ultra\" or \"High\" to \"Medium\" or \"Low\".\n4.  **Turn off demanding features:** Settings like Ray Tracing, high-quality shadows, and anti-aliasing are very resource-intensive. Disabling them can significantly increase your frame rate (FPS).\n\n**Step 3: Optimize Windows Power & Game Settings**\nEnsure Windows is allocating maximum power to your game.\n1.  **Enable Game Mode:** Open the Start Menu, type `Game Mode settings`, and make sure it's turned **On**.\n2.  **Set High Performance Power Plan:**\n    *   Open the Start Menu, type `Choose a power plan`, and press Enter.\n    *   Select the **\"High performance\"** or **\"Ultimate Performance\"** plan. (If you don't see it, click \"Show additional plans\").\n\n**Step 4: Close Background Applications**\nPrograms running in the background consume CPU and RAM that your game could be using. Before you start playing, close unnecessary applications like web browsers, Discord, Spotify, etc.\n\n**Step 5: Check for Overheating**\nCPUs and GPUs automatically slow down (throttle) to prevent damage when they get too hot. This often happens during intense gaming sessions.\n*   **Feel the computer:** If the chassis (especially on a laptop) is unusually hot to the touch, overheating may be the issue.\n*   **Ensure proper airflow:** Make sure vents are not blocked and the internal fans are clean and spinning.\n\nIf these steps don't help, your hardware may not meet the minimum requirements for the game you are trying to play. You might need to consider a hardware upgrade (more RAM, a faster GPU, or a better CPU)."

Refine Your Resume to Showcase Impact:**\n*   **Focus on Achievements, Not Duties:** Instead of \"Wrote APIs for the user service,\" use \"Redesigned the user authentication API, reducing latency by 30% and supporting a 2x increase in traffic.\"\n*   **Use the X-Y-Z Formula:** \"Accomplished **[X]** as measured by **[Y]** by doing **[Z]**.\" Quantify your results whenever possible.\n*   **Highlight Tech Stack & Scope:** Clearly list the technologies you used for each project and describe the scope of your ownership (e.g., \"Led the frontend development for a new reporting dashboard\").\n\n**2. Leverage Strategic Networking:**\n*   **Activate Your Network:** Your most powerful tool is referrals. Reach out to former colleagues, managers, and classmates. Inform them you're looking and ask about opportunities at their companies.\n*   **Targeted LinkedIn Outreach:** Identify 10-20 companies you're interested in. Find their technical recruiters or hiring managers on LinkedIn and send a concise, personalized connection request or message.\n*   **Engage with Inbound Recruiters:** As a mid-level developer, you will get many messages from recruiters. Don't ignore them. Politely respond, even if not interested, and build relationships for the future. For interesting roles, engage promptly.\n\n**3. Prepare for a More Rigorous Interview Loop:**\n*   **System Design is Key:** This is the biggest difference from entry-level interviews. You will be expected to lead a system design discussion. Study common architectures (e.g., microservices, event-driven systems) and practice explaining your trade-offs (e.g., SQL vs. NoSQL, caching strategies).\n*   **Advanced Coding Problems:** Expect LeetCode Medium/Hard questions. Focus on understanding common data structures and algorithms deeply, rather than just memorizing solutions. Be prepared to explain your code's complexity and justify your choices.\n*   **Behavioral Questions on Ownership:** Prepare stories using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) that demonstrate your ability to handle ambiguity, collaborate with cross-functional teams, mentor junior developers, and drive a project to completion.\n\n**4. Be Proactive and Selective in Your Search:**\n*   **Define Your Ideal Role:** Decide on your preferred tech stack, company size (startup vs. enterprise), and industry. This focus will make your search more efficient and your applications more compelling.\n*   **Research Total Compensation:** Use sites like Levels.fyi to understand the market rate for your experience, location, and skillset. Prepare to negotiate not just salary but also equity, signing bonuses, and other benefits."

For Direct, Proven Intervention: Against Malaria Foundation (AMF)**\n   *   **What they do:** AMF funds the purchase and distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets to protect people from malaria, a leading cause of death for children in many parts of the world.\n   *   **Why it's impactful:** This is one of the most cost-effective ways to save lives. The evidence is strong, the impact is measurable, and there is a constant need for more funding.\n   *   **Learn more or donate:** [Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/)\n\n**2. For a Diversified, Expert-Guided Approach: GiveWell's Top Charities Fund**\n   *   **What it does:** This isn't a single charity, but a fund managed by GiveWell. They allocate your donation to their recommended charities where they believe it will have the most impact at that moment. This may include AMF, malnutrition programs, or vitamin A supplement providers.\n   *   **Why it's impactful:** This is an excellent \"default\" option. It leverages GiveWell's ongoing research to direct your money to where it's most needed, saving you the effort of choosing. It's a great way to support a portfolio of proven programs.\n   *   **Learn more or donate:** [GiveWell Top Charities Fund](https://www.givewell.org/top-charities-fund)\n\nBoth options are considered best-in-class for donors seeking to maximize the impact of their contribution to global health."

In a medium bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, thawed and squeezed spinach, egg, 1 cup of the mozzarella, 1/4 cup of the Parmesan, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.\n2.  **First Layer:** Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce (about 1 cup) evenly over the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. This prevents the noodles from sticking. Place a single layer of no-boil noodles on top of the sauce.\n3.  **Second Layer:** Spread half of the ricotta-spinach mixture evenly over the noodles. Top with another layer of noodles.\n4.  **Third Layer:** Pour about 1 cup of marinara sauce over the noodles. Spread the remaining half of the ricotta-spinach mixture on top.\n5.  **Final Layers:** Place the final layer of noodles. Top with the remaining marinara sauce, ensuring the noodles are completely covered. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of mozzarella and 1/4 cup of Parmesan evenly over the top.\n6.  **Bake:** Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil. Bake for 30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until the top is bubbly and lightly browned.\n7.  **Rest:** Let the lasagna rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving. This helps it hold its shape. Enjoy"

You can wear it over dresses, blouses, or even fine-knit sweaters.\n\n**2. The Waistcoat (Vest):**\n*   A tailored waistcoat has become a key piece. It can be worn on its own as a top in warmer weather or layered over a simple long-sleeve tee or button-down shirt.\n\n**3. Elevated Knitwear:**\n*   Fine-gauge knit tops, polo sweaters, and cardigans are replacing traditional blouses for a look that is both comfortable and polished. Look for styles with interesting details like a collared neckline or ribbed texture.\n\n**4. Midi Skirts and Dresses:**\n*   The midi length (falling mid-calf) remains dominant. A-line or pleated midi skirts are versatile and professional. Simple, long-sleeved knit dresses in a midi length are also an easy and elegant option.\n\n**5. Monochromatic Palettes:**\n*   Dressing in a single color (or varying tones of it) creates a sophisticated, elongated look. All-cream, all-navy, or shades of brown are particularly popular and easy to assemble."

Fabric Trends: Texture and Fluidity**\n*   **Tactile Textures:** Fabrics with inherent texture are key. Look for bouclé or tweed for jackets, and ribbed or cable-knit details on sweaters and dresses.\n*   **Luxe Sheen:** Satin, charmeuse, and high-quality viscose are being used for blouses and midi skirts. Their fluid drape and subtle sheen contrast beautifully with structured wool or knit pieces.\n*   **Elevated Knits:** Fine-gauge merino wool and cashmere blends are used for everything from simple shells to polished knit dresses, offering comfort without sacrificing a professional look.\n*   **Polished Leather (and Faux-Leather):** A well-cut leather or high-quality faux-leather skirt (A-line or pencil) or a pair of straight-leg trousers can serve as a modern, sophisticated core piece."

When your mind wanders, you gently guide your attention back to your breath.\n    *   **How it helps stress:** It trains you to stay in the present moment rather than worrying about the future or dwelling on the past. This practice helps break the cycle of anxious thoughts that fuel stress.\n\n2.  **Body Scan Meditation**\n    *   **What it is:** You bring focused attention to different parts of your body, one at a time, from your toes to your head. The goal is to notice any sensations (warmth, tingling, tension) without trying to change them.\n    *   **How it helps stress:** It promotes physical relaxation and helps you become more aware of where you hold tension in your body, allowing you to release it consciously.\n\n3.  **Loving-Kindness Meditation (Metta Meditation)**\n    *   **What it is:** You focus on generating feelings of warmth, kindness, and compassion for yourself and others. You silently repeat phrases like \"May I be happy,\" \"May I be safe,\" \"May you be healthy,\" etc., directing these wishes first to yourself, then to loved ones, neutral people, and finally, even those with whom you have difficulty.\n    *   **How it helps stress:** It can reduce stress by promoting positive emotions and decreasing feelings of anger, resentment, and social isolation.\n\n4.  **Walking Meditation**\n    *   **What it is:** A form of active meditation where you focus on the physical sensation of walking—the movement of your legs, the feeling of your feet touching the ground, and the rhythm of your steps. It's often done at a slow, deliberate pace.\n    *   **How it helps stress:** It combines the benefits of light physical activity with mindfulness, helping to ground you in the present and clear your mind. It's an excellent option for those who find it difficult to sit still.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nYou can try any of these techniques for 5-10 minutes to see which one resonates most with you. Many guided meditations for each type are available on apps and websites like Calm, Headspace, or YouTube."

Its \"white act\" (*ballet blanc*), featuring ethereal, supernatural spirits, became a signature of the period. It fundamentally shifted ballet's focus towards poetic storytelling and established a new standard for the dramatic and technical range required of a ballerina, making it a cornerstone of the repertoire.\n\n2.  ***Swan Lake* (1895 version)**: While the original 1877 production was a failure, the 1895 revival by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov became the archetype for classical ballet. Its grand structure, the iconic dual role of Odette/Odile, and Tchaikovsky's score have made it the most famous ballet in history. It codified many of the conventions of classical ballet that are still followed today.\n\n3.  ***The Rite of Spring* (*Le Sacre du printemps*, 1913)**: A revolutionary work that marked a definitive break from classical tradition and heralded the beginning of modernism in dance. Vaslav Nijinsky's shocking, anti-classical choreography and Igor Stravinsky's dissonant, rhythmically complex score famously caused a riot at its premiere. Its influence was profound, liberating both dance and music from 19th-century constraints and paving the way for countless avant-garde works."

You'll need enough to fill your containers (as a rule of thumb, 1 lb of wax flakes melts to about 16 fl oz of liquid wax).\n*   **Wicks:** Pre-waxed wicks with metal bases. The size depends on your container's diameter; check the wick supplier's recommendations.\n*   **Containers:** Heat-safe glass jars, tins, or ceramic pots.\n*   **Fragrance Oil:** Specifically designed for candle making.\n*   **Double Boiler:** A large pot and a smaller pouring pot (or a heat-safe metal/glass bowl) that fits inside it.\n*   **Thermometer:** A candy or digital thermometer.\n*   **Wick Centering Tools:** Clothespins, chopsticks, or special centering tools work well.\n*   **Optional:** Candle dye chips or liquid dye.\n*   **Safety:** Paper towels or newspaper to protect surfaces, oven mitts.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Prepare Your Workspace:** Cover your work area with newspaper or paper towels. Have all your materials ready.\n2.  **Set Up Containers:** Make sure your jars are clean and dry. Secure a wick to the bottom center of each jar using a wick sticker or a dab of hot glue.\n3.  **Measure and Melt the Wax:**\n    *   Fill a large pot with 1-2 inches of water and bring it to a simmer.\n    *   Place your pouring pot inside the larger pot.\n    *   Add your measured soy wax flakes to the pouring pot.\n    *   Stir occasionally as the wax melts. Heat the wax to **185°F (85°C)**.\n4.  **Add Fragrance & Color:**\n    *   Once the wax reaches 185°F, remove the pouring pot from the heat.\n    *   Add your fragrance oil. A general starting point is 1 oz of oil per 1 lb of wax. Stir gently but thoroughly for about 2 minutes.\n    *   If using dye, add it now and stir until fully dissolved.\n5.  **Cool and Pour:**\n    *   Let the wax cool down to about **135°F (57°C)**. This helps prevent cracks and \"frosting.\"\n    *   Slowly pour the wax into your prepared jars, leaving about a half-inch of space at the top.\n6.  **Center the Wick:** Use your centering tool (like two chopsticks or a clothespin) laid across the jar's rim to hold the wick straight and centered as the wax cools.\n7.  **Cure the Candles:** Let the candles cool and harden at room temperature for at least 24 hours. For the best scent throw, allow them to \"cure\" for 1-2 weeks before lighting.\n8.  **Trim the Wick:** Before the first burn, trim the wick to about ¼ inch. Always trim the wick to this length before each subsequent use."

The key is to balance professionalism with elegance.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option 1: The Tailored Suit**\nA well-fitting suit is a timeless and powerful choice.\n\n*   **Style:** Choose a classic pantsuit or a skirt suit. Modern cuts like a slim-fit trouser or a well-draped, open-front blazer work well.\n*   **Color:** Stick to classic neutrals like navy, charcoal gray, or black. For a subtle statement, consider a deep jewel tone like burgundy or forest green.\n*   **Fabric:** Look for high-quality materials like a wool blend, crepe, or structured tweed.\n*   **Underpinning:** Wear a silk shell, a simple camisole, or a high-quality knit top underneath.\n\n#### **Option 2: The Sophisticated Dress**\nA dress is an elegant and simple solution.\n\n*   **Style:** A sheath, A-line, or wrap dress are all excellent choices. Ensure the fit is impeccable—not too tight or too loose.\n*   **Length & Neckline:** The hemline should be at or just below the knee (midi length is also very current and professional). Necklines should be conservative (e.g., boat neck, jewel, or a modest V-neck).\n*   **Color/Pattern:** Solid colors are safest and most elegant. If you choose a pattern, opt for something subtle like a classic pinstripe or a quiet geometric print.\n*   **Layering:** A coordinating blazer or a structured cardigan can be worn over the dress for added polish.\n\n#### **Option 3: Elegant Separates**\nThis option offers versatility and allows for more personalization.\n\n*   **Top:** A high-quality silk or chiffon blouse.\n*   **Bottom:** Pair the blouse with wide-leg tailored trousers, sharp cigarette pants, or a classic pencil skirt.\n*   **Coordination:** Ensure the top and bottom create a cohesive and polished silhouette.\n\n---\n\n#### **Key Finishing Touches**\n\n*   **Footwear:** Closed-toe pumps or elegant block heels are standard. Polished, high-quality flats are also an acceptable alternative.\n*   **Handbag:** A structured leather tote or a sophisticated clutch. Avoid overly casual or oversized bags.\n*   **Accessories:** Keep jewelry minimal and classic. A simple watch, pearl or diamond stud earrings, and a delicate necklace are perfect.\n*   **Grooming:** A polished hairstyle (e.g., a sleek blowout, a tidy updo) and professional, understated makeup complete the look."

The request is to find an organizational system for a physical office desk primarily cluttered with paperwork.\n\n**Summary:** You need a system to manage paperwork clutter on your physical office desk.\n\nHere is a simple and effective system called the **Four-Tray Method** to manage your paperwork.\n\n### The Four-Tray Paperwork System\n\nThe goal is to touch each piece of paper only once as you sort it. Get four simple trays or vertical file holders and label them.\n\n1.  **INBOX:**\n    *   **What it's for:** All new papers go directly into this tray. Mail, notes, documents people hand you—everything. Do not let paper pile up anywhere else on your desk.\n    *   **Routine:** Process this tray once a day or every other day.\n\n2.  **TO-DO / ACTION:**\n    *   **What it's for:** Items from your INBOX that require a specific action (e.g., \"pay this bill,\" \"sign this form,\" \"read this report\").\n    *   **Routine:** Work through these items during your dedicated work blocks. Set a weekly goal to clear this tray.\n\n3.  **TO-FILE:**\n    *   **What it's for:** Documents that need to be kept for reference or long-term storage but require no immediate action (e.g., paid bills, contracts, tax documents).\n    *   **Routine:** Once a week, take everything from this tray and file it away in your main filing cabinet or document archive.\n\n4.  **TO-SCAN / SHRED:**\n    *   **What it's for:** Papers you want to keep digitally or that can be discarded. This includes reference materials you can scan, or sensitive documents that need shredding.\n    *   **Routine:** Weekly, scan the documents, confirm they are saved and backed up, and then shred the originals.\n\n### How to Implement It:\n\n*   **Step 1: The Purge.** Gather *all* loose paper from your desk and sort it into the four categories above. If it's trash, throw it out immediately. This will be the hardest part, but it's a one-time setup.\n*   **Step 2: Daily Habit.** At the end of each day, take 5 minutes to clear any new papers from your desk and put them in the INBOX.\n*   **Step 3: Weekly Review.** Every Friday (or a day of your choice), dedicate 30 minutes to clearing your other trays: complete your TO-DOs, file your TO-FILE items, and scan/shred the rest.\n\nThis system prevents paper from accumulating and gives you a clear, repeatable process for keeping your desk tidy."

The user has specified they want a comprehensive overview of fiddle leaf fig care.\n\n**Task:** Provide a comprehensive care guide for a fiddle leaf fig plant.\n\nHere is a comprehensive care guide for your fiddle leaf fig (*Ficus lyrata*).\n\n---\n\n### **Comprehensive Fiddle Leaf Fig Care Guide**\n\nFiddle leaf figs are popular but can be particular about their environment. Consistency is key.\n\n#### **1. Light**\n*   **Requirement:** Lots of bright, indirect sunlight is crucial. An east-facing window is often ideal, providing gentle morning sun. A spot a few feet away from a south or west-facing window also works.\n*   **Avoid:** Direct, intense afternoon sun, which will scorch the leaves. Insufficient light will lead to slow growth and leaf drop.\n*   **Tip:** Rotate your plant a quarter turn each week to ensure all sides get even light exposure, promoting upright growth.\n\n#### **2. Watering**\n*   **When:** Water thoroughly when the top 2-3 inches of soil feel dry to the touch. This might be once every 7-10 days, but it varies based on light, temperature, and season.\n*   **How:** Pour water evenly over the soil surface until it flows out of the drainage holes. Discard any excess water from the saucer to prevent root rot.\n*   **Key Mistake to Avoid:** Overwatering. They are much less tolerant of wet feet than they are of being slightly dry.\n\n#### **3. Soil**\n*   **Type:** A well-draining, nutrient-rich potting mix is essential. Standard indoor potting soil with added perlite or orchid bark (about a 3:1 ratio) works well to improve drainage and aeration.\n\n#### **4. Temperature & Humidity**\n*   **Temperature:** They thrive in warm conditions, ideally between 65-85°F (18-29°C).\n*   **Humidity:** They prefer a humid environment. If your home is dry, consider misting the leaves every few days, placing the plant near a humidifier, or setting it on a pebble tray with water.\n*   **Avoid:** Cold drafts from windows, doors, or air conditioning vents. Sudden temperature changes can cause leaf drop.\n\n#### **5. Fertilizing**\n*   **Frequency:** Feed your plant during the growing season (spring and summer). Use a balanced liquid fertilizer formulated for houseplants, diluted to half-strength, once every 2-4 weeks.\n*   **Dormancy:** Do not fertilize in the fall and winter when the plant's growth naturally slows.\n\n#### **6. Pruning & Repotting**\n*   **Pruning:** You can prune your plant to maintain its shape, control its height, or remove any dead/damaged leaves. Pinching off the top bud can encourage the plant to branch out.\n*   **Repotting:** Repot every 1-2 years, or when you see roots growing out of the drainage holes. Choose a pot that is only 2 inches larger in diameter than the current one.\n\n#### **7. Common Problems**\n*   **Brown Spots:** Can be caused by underwatering (crispy, dry spots), root rot from overwatering (dark brown/black soft spots, often starting at the edge), or bacterial infection.\n*   **Dropping Leaves:** This is a common sign of stress, often caused by a recent move, changes in light/temperature (drafts), or improper watering (both over and under).\n*   **Pests:** Inspect regularly for common pests like spider mites and mealybugs, especially on the undersides of leaves. Treat with neem oil or insecticidal soap if found."

      "content": "**Clarity Check: CLEAR**\nThe task is to create a 7-day guided meditation plan for beginners with the specific goal of reducing stress and anxiety. I can now provide a direct answer.\n\nHere is a week-long guided meditation plan tailored for beginners focused on stress and anxiety reduction. The sessions are short to help you build a consistent habit.\n\n### A 7-Day Meditation Plan for Stress Reduction\n\n**Goal:** To establish a daily practice for calming the mind and body.\n**Tip:** Find a quiet place where you won't be disturbed. Sit comfortably on a chair or cushion with your back straight.\n\n---\n\n**Day 1: Mindful Breathing (5 minutes)**\n*   **Focus:** The physical sensation of breathing.\n*   **How-to:** Close your eyes and bring your attention to your breath. Notice the feeling of the air entering your nose, filling your lungs, and then leaving your body. When your mind wanders (which it will), gently guide your attention back to your breath without judgment. This is the core practice of mindfulness.\n\n**Day 2: Body Scan Meditation (10 minutes)**\n*   **Focus:** Releasing physical tension.\n*   **How-to:** Lie down if possible. Bring your attention to your toes. Notice any sensations without judging them. Then, slowly move your focus up through your body—feet, legs, torso, arms, neck, and head. As you scan, intentionally relax each muscle group, releasing any stored stress.\n\n**Day 3: Loving-Kindness Meditation (10 minutes)**\n*   **Focus:** Cultivating compassion to counteract anxious thoughts.\n*   **How-to:** With your eyes closed, silently repeat phrases of goodwill. Start with yourself: \"May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be safe.\" Then, extend these wishes to someone you love, a neutral person, and eventually, even to those with whom you have difficulty. This practice helps soften feelings of anxiety and irritation.\n\n**Day 4: Noting Thoughts & Feelings (10 minutes)**\n*   **Focus:** Observing anxiety without getting caught in it.\n*   **How-to:** As you sit and breathe, notice when thoughts or feelings arise. Silently label them (e.g., \"thinking,\" \"worrying,\" \"anxious feeling\"). The goal is not to stop the thoughts, but to see them as temporary events passing through your mind, which reduces their power over you.\n\n**Day 5: Mindful Breathing (7 minutes)**\n*   **Focus:** Reinforcing the foundation.\n*   **How-to:** Return to the simple practice from Day 1. Notice if it feels any different. Your ability to return your focus to the breath is a \"rep\" for your attention muscle.\n\n**Day 6: Body Scan Meditation (12 minutes)**\n*   **Focus:** Deepening physical relaxation.\n*   **How-to:** Repeat the body scan from Day 2, moving a little more slowly. Pay special attention to common areas of tension like your jaw, shoulders, and stomach. Breathe into these areas and imagine the tension melting away with each exhale.\n\n**Day 7: Visualization for Calm (10 minutes)**\n*   **Focus:** Using imagery to create a feeling of peace.\n*   **How-to:** While breathing deeply, imagine a place where you feel completely safe and calm—a quiet beach, a forest, or a cozy room. Use all your senses: What do you see? Hear? Smell? Feel? Rest in this peaceful place for the duration of the meditation. Return to it in your mind anytime you feel stressed during the day."

Feeney is known for shocking twists, and this novel is a masterclass in suspense and misdirection.\n\n2.  ***The Last Thing He Told Me*** **by Laura Dave:** A woman's husband vanishes, leaving behind a cryptic note: \"Protect her.\" This propels her into a desperate search for the truth, forming an uneasy alliance with her teenage stepdaughter who wants nothing to do with her. It was a massive bestseller with a plot that keeps you guessing.\n\n3.  ***The Push*** **by Ashley Audrain:** This is a darker, more intense psychological study. A new mother struggles with the belief that her daughter is manipulative and malevolent, a fear rooted in her own traumatic family history. It's a gripping and unsettling look at motherhood and nature vs. nurture."

Do not overmix. The batter will be very thick. If using, fold in the dairy-free chocolate chips.\n6.  **Bake:** Spread the batter evenly into your prepared pan. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs attached, but not wet batter.\n7.  **Cool Completely:** This is a crucial step! Let the brownies cool in the pan completely (at least 1 hour) before lifting them out and cutting them. This ensures they set properly and don't crumble.\n\nEnjoy your delicious homemade brownies"

Continuing to ask narrow questions is unlikely to be productive.\n\nInstead of asking another question, I will provide a comprehensive guide that covers the common scenarios we've identified. You can then apply the section that best matches your specific needs.\n\n### Summary of Your Goal\nBased on our conversation, your goal is to replace plaintext passwords found in files like configurations and scripts. The correct method depends on whether the password needs to be **verified** (for a user login) or **used** (by an application to connect to a service).\n\n---\n\n### Solution: How to Handle Passwords in Files\n\nHere are solutions for the three most common scenarios.\n\n#### Scenario 1: Hashing for User Login Verification\nUse this when you need to check if a user provided the correct password, without storing the password itself. The application will store the *hash* and compare it against a hash of the user's input.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n1.  **Choose an Algorithm:** Use a modern, strong hashing algorithm like **Argon2** (preferred), **scrypt**, or **bcrypt**. Do not use MD5 or SHA-1.\n2.  **Generate a Hash:** When a user sets their password, generate a hash with a unique salt and store it.\n3.  **Verify on Login:** When a user logs in, hash their input password with the same salt and compare it to the stored hash.\n\n**Example (Python using `argon2-cffi`):**\n```python\n# pip install argon2-cffi\nfrom argon2 import PasswordHasher\n\nph = PasswordHasher()\n\n# --- To create and store a hash (e.g., during user sign-up) ---\noriginal_password = \"default_password_123\"\n# The hash includes the algorithm, salt, and hash value in one string\nstored_hash = ph.hash(original_password)\nprint(f\"Store this hash: {stored_hash}\")\n# Example output: $argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$...\n\n# --- To verify a password (e.g., during login) ---\ninput_password = \"default_password_123\"\ntry:\n    ph.verify(stored_hash, input_password)\n    print(\"Password is valid.\")\nexcept Exception:\n    print(\"Password is NOT valid.\")\n```\n\n#### Scenario 2: Securing Credentials for Application Use\nUse this when an application or script needs to *use* the password to connect to a database, API, or other service. **Hashing does not work here** because the original password cannot be recovered from a hash. The goal is to avoid storing the password in the code or config file directly.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n1.  **Externalize the Secret:** Move the password out of your file system and into a more secure location.\n    *   **Best Practice:** Use a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., **HashiCorp Vault**, **AWS Secrets Manager**, **Google Secret Manager**, or **Kubernetes/Docker Secrets**).\n    *   **Good Practice:** Use **Environment Variables**. This is simple and effective for many use cases.\n2.  **Update Your Code:** Modify the application to read the password from the external source at runtime.\n\n**Example (Python using Environment Variables):**\n\n1.  **In your shell (before running the app):**\n    ```bash\n    # Set the environment variable\n    export DB_PASSWORD=\"my_secret_db_password\"\n    ```\n2.  **In your application code (e.g., `config.py`):**\n    ```python\n    import os\n\n    # Read the password from the environment variable\n    # The second argument is a default value if the variable isn't set\n    db_password = os.getenv(\"DB_PASSWORD\", \"default_dev_password\")\n\n    # Now use db_password to connect to your database\n    print(\"Connecting with the retrieved password...\")\n    ```\n\n#### Scenario 3: Finding and Replacing Hardcoded Passwords\nUse this to locate plaintext passwords across your file system so you can apply the solutions from Scenario 1 or 2.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n1.  **Find Potential Secrets:** Use command-line tools to search for common password patterns or keywords. This is an initial scan and will require manual review.\n    ```bash\n    # Search for lines containing 'password', 'passwd', 'secret', etc., case-insensitively\n    # The -r flag searches recursively, -n shows line numbers, -i is for case-insensitivity\n    grep -rni \"password\\|passwd\\|secret\\|token\" /path/to/your/project\n\n    # You can also use more advanced secret-scanning tools like 'trufflehog' or 'gitleaks'\n    ```\n2.  **Analyze and Replace:** For each finding, determine its purpose:\n    *   Is it for user login? **Replace it using the method in Scenario 1.**\n    *   Is it for application access? **Replace it using the method in Scenario 2.**\n    *   Is it a false positive (e.g., in a comment)? Ignore it."

Your goal is to identify digital marketing trends from 2021 that remain important for today's strategies.\n\nHere are key trends from 2021 and their continued relevance for modern marketing:\n\n### 1. The Pivot to Privacy-Centric Marketing\n*   **In 2021:** Apple's iOS 14.5 update introduced App Tracking Transparency (ATT), fundamentally restricting ad tracking. This accelerated the industry's move away from third-party cookies and towards privacy-first approaches.\n*   **Relevance Today:** This is no longer a trend but the new standard. Effective marketing now relies on **first-party data** (collected directly from your audience, e.g., email sign-ups) and **zero-party data** (proactively shared by customers, e.g., preference surveys). Building trust and providing value in exchange for data is critical.\n\n### 2. The Dominance of Short-Form Video\n*   **In 2021:** The explosive growth of TikTok and the expansion of Instagram Reels cemented short-form video as a key format for engaging audiences, particularly younger demographics.\n*   **Relevance Today:** Short-form video is a foundational element of content strategy. It's essential for brand discovery, community building, and authentic storytelling on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube Shorts. The emphasis is on creativity, authenticity, and entertainment value over high-production polish.\n\n### 3. AI-Powered Personalization\n*   **In 2021:** Artificial Intelligence was increasingly used to analyze user behavior, personalize content recommendations (like on Netflix or Amazon), and power customer service chatbots.\n*   **Relevance Today:** The advent of Generative AI has massively amplified this. AI is now central to marketing for content creation, hyper-personalizing customer journeys at scale, predictive analytics, and optimizing ad spend. Leveraging AI tools is a significant competitive advantage.\n\n### 4. The Rise of Social Commerce\n*   **In 2021:** Platforms like Instagram and Facebook heavily promoted in-app shopping features, allowing users to browse and buy products directly within the social media environment.\n*   **Relevance Today:** Social commerce has matured into a major sales channel, with TikTok Shop becoming a dominant force. The strategy has evolved to focus on a seamless path from discovery to purchase, often driven by creator/influencer content and live shopping events."

The user wants a general overview of the different starting paths in amateur astronomy.\n\nTask: Provide a general overview of getting started in amateur astronomy, covering different paths, equipment, and resources.\n\nHere is an overview of the three main paths for getting started in amateur astronomy. The best approach is often to start with Path A to build a foundation before investing in more expensive equipment.\n\n### **Path A: Learning the Night Sky**\n\nThis path focuses on learning to navigate the sky using just your eyes or basic tools. It's the essential first step for any amateur astronomer.\n\n*   **Goal:** Identify constellations, bright stars, and planets. Track meteor showers and satellite passes.\n*   **Equipment Needed:**\n    *   **Your Eyes:** The most important tool.\n    *   **A Planisphere (Star Wheel):** A rotating star map that shows what's visible on any given date and time.\n    *   **Binoculars:** A standard pair of 7x50 or 10x50 binoculars are excellent for a closer look at the Moon, star clusters, and the Andromeda Galaxy. They are a great, affordable step before a telescope.\n    *   **Red-Light Flashlight:** Preserves your night vision while allowing you to read maps.\n*   **Beginner Resources:**\n    *   **Apps:** Stellarium Mobile, SkyView, Star Walk 2. These apps use your phone's GPS to show you what you're looking at in real-time.\n    *   **Book:** *\"Turn Left at Orion\"* is widely considered the best hands-on guide for beginners with binoculars or a small telescope.\n    *   **Websites:** Heavens-Above.com for tracking the International Space Station (ISS) and other satellites.\n\n### **Path B: Observing Through a Telescope**\n\nThis is the classic path for those who want to see distant objects in greater detail.\n\n*   **Goal:** See craters on the Moon, the rings of Saturn, Jupiter's cloud bands and moons, and faint deep-sky objects like nebulae and galaxies.\n*   **Equipment Needed:**\n    *   **A good beginner telescope.** Avoid cheap \"department store\" telescopes that advertise huge magnification. The best recommendations are:\n        *   **Dobsonian Telescope (e.g., 6\" or 8\"):** Often called a \"light bucket,\" this type offers the most aperture (light-gathering ability) for your money. It's simple, sturdy, and fantastic for visual observing.\n        *   **Tabletop Reflector (e.g., AWB OneSky / Sky-Watcher Heritage 130P):** A compact, affordable, and highly-regarded option.\n*   **Beginner Resources:**\n    *   **Local Astronomy Club:** The single best resource. You can look through different types of telescopes and get hands-on advice before you buy.\n    *   **Forums:** CloudyNights.com is a large and active community with dedicated forums for beginners.\n\n### **Path C: Astrophotography (Taking Pictures)**\n\nThis is the most technically demanding and expensive path, but also incredibly rewarding.\n\n*   **Goal:** Capture images of the night sky, from wide shots of the Milky Way to detailed pictures of distant galaxies.\n*   **Equipment Needed (can be simple or complex):**\n    *   **Beginner (Landscape Astrophotography):** Any DSLR or mirrorless camera with manual controls, a tripod, and a lens (a wide, fast lens is best for Milky Way shots).\n    *   **Intermediate (Deep Sky):** The above, plus a **star tracker**. This small device rotates your camera to counteract Earth's rotation, allowing for long exposures without star trails.\n    *   **Advanced:** A telescope on a computerized equatorial mount, dedicated astronomy cameras, filters, and guiding equipment.\n*   **Beginner Resources:**\n    *   **Software:** DeepSkyStacker (free) for combining multiple images to reduce noise.\n    *   **YouTube:** Channels like AstroBackyard and Nebula Photos offer excellent tutorials for all skill levels.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nStart with **Path A**. Spend a few months learning the constellations with your eyes and a sky map app. Then, add a pair of **10x50 binoculars**. This small investment will let you explore hundreds of objects and help you decide if you want to commit to the expense and learning curve of a full telescope (Path B) or astrophotography gear (Path C)."

Instruct them to call for help (e.g., park rangers, 911) if you don't check in by a specific time.\n2.  **Check Weather & Conditions:** Check the weather forecast right before you leave. Mountain weather can change rapidly. Also, check for trail condition reports (e.g., on park websites or apps like AllTrails).\n3.  **Know Your Route & Have a Backup:** Study your map before you go. Use a GPS app on a fully charged phone, but carry a backup power bank *and* a physical map and compass as a non-electronic backup.\n4.  **Start Early:** Give yourself the maximum amount of daylight and a buffer for unexpected delays. The goal is to be back at the trailhead well before sunset.\n5.  **Know Your Limits & Be Prepared to Turn Back:** Pride is dangerous. If the weather turns, you feel unwell, or the trail is more difficult than you anticipated, turning around is the safest decision. Your planned destination is not as important as your safe return.\n6.  **Maintain Situational Awareness:** Pay attention to your surroundings. Watch for trail markers, be aware of potential wildlife, and listen for changes in the weather.\n\n### **Essential Gear (Based on the \"Ten Essentials\")**\n\nFor a strenuous day hike, you should carry these items in a comfortable daypack (20-30L capacity).\n\n*   **1. Navigation:**\n    *   **Primary:** Phone with a GPS app (e.g., AllTrails, Gaia GPS) with maps downloaded for offline use.\n    *   **Backup:** Portable power bank and a physical map and compass.\n*   **2. Headlamp:** A must-have, even on a day hike. If you're delayed, you'll need it to see. Bring extra batteries.\n*   **3. Sun Protection:** Sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat. Sunburn and exposure are more intense at higher elevations.\n*   **4. First-Aid Kit:** Include blister care (moleskin), bandages, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, and any personal medications.\n*   **5. Knife or Multi-tool:** Useful for repairs, first aid, and food.\n*   **6. Fire:** Waterproof matches, a lighter, or a fire starter for emergency situations.\n*   **7. Emergency Shelter:** An ultralight emergency bivy or space blanket. It can be life-saving if you are unexpectedly forced to spend the night.\n*   **8. Extra Food:** Pack at least one day's worth of extra, no-cook, high-energy food (e.g., extra energy bars, nuts, dried fruit).\n*   **9. Extra Water:** Carry more water than you expect to drink and bring a lightweight water filter or purification tablets to treat water from sources on the trail.\n*   **10. Extra Layers:** Pack a waterproof jacket and an insulating layer (like a fleece or puffy jacket), regardless of the forecast. Temperatures can drop suddenly.\n\nHave a great and safe hike"

This is a classic web scraping problem that usually indicates the website loads its content dynamically using JavaScript.\n\n**Task Summary:** Provide a revised Python script that can handle JavaScript-rendered websites, which is the likely reason the first script failed to find headlines.\n\nThe previous script using `requests` only fetches the initial HTML source of the page. If headlines are loaded by JavaScript *after* the initial page load, `requests` won't see them.\n\nThe solution is to use a tool like **Selenium**, which automates a real web browser (like Chrome or Firefox) to render the page fully, including any dynamic content.\n\nHere is an updated script that uses `Selenium` to load the page and then `BeautifulSoup` to parse it.\n\n### Step 1: Install Selenium and a Webdriver\n\nFirst, install the `selenium` library:\n\n```bash\npip install selenium beautifulsoup4\n```\n\nNext, you need a \"webdriver,\" which is a separate application that Selenium uses to control your browser. The easiest way is to let a tool like `webdriver-manager` handle it for you.\n\n```bash\npip install webdriver-manager\n```\n\n### Step 2: Revised Python Scraper Script\n\nThis script uses Selenium to open Chrome, wait for the page to load, and then extracts the headlines.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport csv\nimport time\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service as ChromeService\nfrom webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\n\n# --- CONFIGURATION: YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THIS ---\n# The URL of the news website you want to scrape.\nURL = \"https://www.your-news-website.com/\" # <-- CHANGE THIS\n# The specific HTML element and class that contains the headline text.\n# You must find this using your browser's \"Inspect\" tool.\nHEADLINE_TAG = \"h2\" # <-- EXAMPLE, CHANGE THIS\nHEADLINE_CLASS = \"story-heading\" # <-- EXAMPLE, CHANGE THIS\n# --- END OF CONFIGURATION ---\n\ndef scrape_headlines_dynamic(url, tag, class_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Scrapes headlines from a dynamic website using Selenium to render JavaScript.\n    \"\"\"\n    options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()\n    options.add_argument(\"--headless\")  # Run browser in the background\n    options.add_argument(\"--disable-gpu\")\n    options.add_argument(\"user-agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36\")\n\n    driver = None\n    try:\n        # Set up the Chrome driver automatically\n        driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=ChromeService(ChromeDriverManager().install()), options=options)\n\n        # Fetch the content from the URL\n        driver.get(url)\n\n        # IMPORTANT: Wait for the elements to be present on the page.\n        # This gives JavaScript time to run.

This is more efficient because it waits *only as long as necessary* for the headlines to appear (up to 10 seconds).\n3.  **Update Your Configuration**: You still need to find the correct `URL`, `HEADLINE_TAG`, and `HEADLINE_CLASS` for your target website by using the \"Inspect\" tool in your browser. This step is critical.\n\nThis approach is much more robust and should solve the problem of content not being found."

Make sure you have TensorFlow installed: `pip install tensorflow`\n2.  Save the code below as a Python file (e.g., `cnn_mnist.py`).\n3.  Run it from your terminal: `python cnn_mnist.py`\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras import datasets, layers, models\n\n# 1. Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset\n(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.mnist.load_data()\n\n# Normalize pixel values to be between 0 and 1\ntrain_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\n\n# Add a channels dimension (for grayscale images)\ntrain_images = train_images[..., tf.newaxis]\ntest_images = test_images[..., tf.newaxis]\n\n# 2. Build the Convolutional Neural Network model\nmodel = models.Sequential([\n    # Convolutional layer with 32 filters, a 3x3 kernel, and ReLU activation\n    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),\n    # Max pooling layer to downsample the feature map\n    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\n    # Flatten the 3D output to 1D\n    layers.Flatten(),\n    # A dense (fully-connected) layer with 64 units and ReLU activation\n    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\n    # The output layer with 10 units (one for each digit) and softmax activation\n    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n# You can print the model summary to see its structure\nmodel.summary()\n\n# 3. Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\n              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# 4. Train the model\nprint(\"\\n--- Training the model ---\")\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5, batch_size=64, validation_split=0.1)\n\n# 5. Evaluate the model\nprint(\"\\n--- Evaluating the model ---\")\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint(f\"\\nTest accuracy: {test_acc:.4f}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   **1. Load and Preprocess Data**: We load the built-in MNIST dataset. The images are normalized to a `[0, 1]` range and a channel dimension is added, which is required for convolutional layers in TensorFlow.\n*   **2. Build the Model**: A `Sequential` model is created.\n    *   `Conv2D`: Scans the images with 32 filters to create feature maps.\n    *   `MaxPooling2D`: Reduces the size of the feature maps, helping the model generalize.\n    *   `Flatten`: Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector to be fed into the dense layers.\n    *   `Dense`: Standard fully-connected neural network layers. The final one uses `softmax` to output a probability for each of the 10 digit classes.\n*   **3. Compile**: The model is configured for training. `adam` is a standard optimizer, and `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` is used as the loss function because our labels are integers (0-9).\n*   **4. Train**: The model is trained for 5 epochs (passes over the entire dataset).\n*   **5. Evaluate**: The trained model's performance is measured on the test set, which it has never seen before. You should see an accuracy of around 98-99%."

Some models have coils behind a grille at the bottom front.\n*   **Clean:** Use a condenser coil brush (available at hardware stores) and a vacuum cleaner to gently remove all dust and debris from the coils, the fan, and the surrounding area.\n*   **Restore Power:** Plug the fridge back in and push it back into place, leaving a few inches for air circulation.\n\n**2. Observe the Sound:**\nAfter cleaning, listen to the fridge as it starts its cooling cycle again. In most cases, the buzzing will be noticeably quieter.\n\nIf the loud buzzing persists after a thorough cleaning, or if it changes to a grinding or clicking noise, it could indicate a failing condenser fan motor or a more serious compressor issue.

The first is a powerful manual method you can implement now, and the second is a look at fully automated solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach 1: Use a Single \"Smart\" Filter for Many Subjects (Powerful Manual Method)**\n\nInstead of creating one filter for \"Project A,\" another for \"Project B,\" etc., you can create a single, powerful filter using search operators or regular expressions. This is highly efficient for subjects that follow a pattern.\n\nHere’s how to do it in **Gmail** using search operators:\n\n**Goal:** File all emails with subjects like \"Weekly Report: Sales\" or \"Weekly Report: Marketing\" into a single \"Weekly Reports\" folder.\n\n1.  **Open Filter Creation:**\n    *   Click the **Settings gear icon (⚙️)** > **\"See all settings.\"**\n    *   Go to the **\"Filters and Blocked Addresses\"** tab and click **\"Create a new filter.\"**\n\n2.  **Define the \"Smart\" Criteria:**\n    *   In the **\"Subject\"** field, use quotes and the `OR` operator. Type:\n        `\"Weekly Report: Sales\" OR \"Weekly Report: Marketing\" OR \"Weekly Report: Engineering\"`\n    *   *Alternatively, for subjects with a common prefix*, you can simply type the prefix in quotes:\n        `\"Weekly Report:\"`\n\n3.  **Choose the Action:**\n    *   Click **\"Create filter.\"**\n    *   Check **\"Apply the label\"** and choose or create a label (e.g., \"Weekly Reports\").\n    *   (Optional) Check **\"Also apply filter to matching conversations\"** to organize existing emails.\n\n4.  **Save the Filter:**\n    *   Click **\"Create filter.\"**\n\nThis single rule now handles multiple related subjects, and you can edit it to add more `OR` conditions later instead of creating new rules. Some advanced email clients (like a desktop version of Outlook) support even more powerful pattern matching with \"regular expressions\" for ultimate flexibility.\n\n### **Approach 2: Use an AI-Powered Automated System**\n\nThis approach addresses your interest in a system that automatically identifies subjects and creates folders. This is not a standard feature in most free email clients like Gmail or Yahoo. It requires third-party services that use AI to analyze your incoming mail.\n\n*   **How it works:** These services connect to your email account and learn your organization patterns over time. They can identify recurring topics (like invoices, newsletters, or project updates) and suggest or automatically create rules and folders for you.\n*   **Examples of Services:**\n    *   **SaneBox:** An AI-powered service that analyzes your email history to learn what's important and automatically sorts non-urgent mail into a separate folder.\n    *   **Superhuman:** A premium email client with built-in AI features that help you triage and sort mail at high speed.\n\nThis approach is \"hands-off\" but typically involves a monthly subscription fee and requires giving a third-party service access to your email."

The user has specified they want a general overview of impactful 20th-century education theorists, covering a mix of developmental psychology, teaching methods, and social critique.\n\nHere is a summary of four of the most impactful education theorists of the 20th century, selected to provide a balanced overview.\n\n***\n\n### Key 20th-Century Education Theorists: A General Overview\n\nThis list covers influential figures whose work shaped our understanding of child development, classroom methods, and the social purpose of education.\n\n#### 1. Jean Piaget (1896-1980)\nPiaget's work revolutionized our understanding of how children's minds develop, establishing the idea that children actively construct their own knowledge.\n\n*   **Key Contribution: Stages of Cognitive Development.** Piaget proposed four sequential stages that characterize the development of intelligence:\n    *   **Sensorimotor (0-2 years):** Learning through senses and actions.\n    *   **Preoperational (2-7 years):** Beginning to use language and symbols, but thinking is egocentric.\n    *   **Concrete Operational (7-11 years):** Thinking logically about concrete events.\n    *   **Formal Operational (12+ years):** Developing abstract reasoning and hypothetical thought.\n*   **Impact:** His theory of **constructivism**—the idea that learners build knowledge from experience rather than just passively receiving it—is a cornerstone of modern educational practice.\n\n#### 2. John Dewey (1859-1952)\nDewey was a philosopher and educational reformer who advocated for \"progressive education,\" arguing that schools should reflect real life and prepare students for democratic citizenship.\n\n*   **Key Contribution: Experiential Learning.** Dewey is famous for the principle of **\"learning by doing.\"** He argued that education must be based on experience, connecting curriculum to students' lives and interests.\n*   **Impact:** His ideas promoted hands-on, project-based learning, problem-solving, and critical thinking over rote memorization. He also emphasized the social role of schools in fostering a democratic society.\n\n#### 3. Lev Vygotsky (1896-1934)\nVygotsky was a Soviet psychologist who emphasized the fundamental role of social interaction and culture in cognitive development.\n\n*   **Key Contribution: Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD).** The ZPD is the difference between what a learner can do without help and what they can achieve with guidance from a \"More Knowledgeable Other\" (a teacher, peer, or parent).\n*   **Impact:** Vygotsky's **sociocultural theory** highlighted the importance of collaborative learning, scaffolding (providing support that is gradually removed), and language in shaping thought. His work forms the basis for many modern collaborative teaching strategies.\n\n#### 4. Paulo Freire (1921-1997)\nFreire was a Brazilian educator whose work focused on \"critical pedagogy,\" arguing that education should be a tool for social justice and liberation.\n\n*   **Key Contribution: Critiquing the \"Banking Model\" of Education.** In his seminal work, *Pedagogy of the Oppressed*, Freire condemned a traditional approach where teachers \"deposit\" information into passive students. He advocated for a problem-posing model where teachers and students co-create knowledge.\n*   **Impact:** Freire's ideas have been highly influential in movements for social justice, adult literacy, and critical thinking, encouraging educators to empower students to question and transform their social realities."

The user wants to build a basic informational website to display business details like services, location, and hours using a free content management system (CMS).\n\n**Summary:** Your goal is to create a simple, informational website for your small business. For this purpose, I recommend using **WordPress.org**. It's the world's most popular free CMS, perfect for creating the exact pages you need (services, location, contact info).\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide to get started.\n\n---\n\n### **How to Create Your Business Website with WordPress**\n\nWhile WordPress itself is free, you will need two things to make your site live on the internet:\n1.  **Domain Name:** Your website's address (e.g., `www.yourbusiness.com`). (~$15/year)\n2.  **Web Hosting:** A service that stores your website's files and makes them accessible online. (~$3-$10/month for basic plans)\n\nMany hosting providers offer a free domain name for the first year when you sign up for a hosting plan.\n\n**Step 1: Get Your Domain and Hosting**\n1.  **Choose a Hosting Provider:** Select a reputable host known for WordPress compatibility (e.g., Bluehost, SiteGround, Hostinger).\n2.  **Select a Plan:** For a new informational site, their most basic plan is sufficient.\n3.  **Register Your Domain:** During signup, you'll be prompted to choose your domain name.\n\n**Step 2: Install WordPress**\nMost modern hosts offer a \"one-click\" WordPress installation. Look for this option in your hosting account's control panel. It will automatically set up the CMS on your domain.\n\n**Step 3: Choose a Theme**\nA theme controls your site's visual design.\n1.  Log in to your WordPress dashboard (usually at `www.yourbusiness.com/wp-admin`).\n2.  Navigate to **Appearance > Themes > Add New**.\n3.  Search for free business-oriented themes like \"Astra,\" \"Neve,\" or \"Blocksy.\"\n4.  Hover over a theme you like, click **Install**, and then **Activate**.\n\n**Step 4: Create Your Essential Pages**\n1.  In your dashboard, go to **Pages > Add New**.\n2.  Create the following essential pages for an informational site:\n    *   **Home:** A welcome page summarizing your business.\n    *   **About Us:** Tell your story and introduce your team.\n    *   **Services:** Detail what you offer.\n    *   **Contact Us:** Include your address, phone number, email, and a contact form.\n3.  Add your text and images to each page using the block editor.\n\n**Step 5: Set Up Your Navigation Menu**\n1.  Go to **Appearance > Menus**.\n2.  Create a new menu, add the pages you just created, and assign it to the \"Primary Menu\" location of your theme. This makes your pages easily accessible to visitors.\n\nYour basic informational website is now live. You can continue to customize it by adding your logo, changing colors, or installing plugins for more functionality (like a contact form)."

I will provide a Python script to send an email via Gmail, which can be scheduled to run at a specific time.\n\nHere is a complete solution using Python to send an email with Gmail, along with instructions on how to schedule it.\n\n### Summary of Your Goal\nYou want a Python script that sends an email through your Gmail account. This script should be set up to run automatically at a specific time you define.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Gmail Account\nFor security, you cannot use your regular Google password in a script. You must create a dedicated \"App Password\".\n\n1.  **Enable 2-Step Verification** on your Google Account if you haven't already.\n2.  **Create an App Password:** Go to your Google Account's [App Passwords page](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).\n    *   Select \"Mail\" for the app and \"Other (Custom name)\" for the device.\n    *   Name it something like \"Python Email Script\".\n    *   Google will generate a 16-character password. **Copy this password immediately.** You will not be able to see it again.\n\n### Step 2: The Python Script\nThis script uses Python's built-in libraries to send the email.\n\n1.  Create a new file named `send_email.py`.\n2.  Copy and paste the code below into the file.\n3.  Fill in the configuration variables with your details.\n\n```python\n# send_email.py\n\nimport smtplib\nimport ssl\n\n# --- CONFIGURATION ---\n# Fill these variables with your information\n\nsender_email = \"your_email@gmail.com\"\n# IMPORTANT: Use the 16-character App Password you generated, NOT your regular password.\napp_password = \"paste_your_16_character_app_password_here\"\nreceiver_email = \"recipient_email@example.com\"\n\nsubject = \"Scheduled Email Subject\"\nbody = \"\"\"\nThis is the body of your automated email.\nYou can write multiple lines here.\n\"\"\"\n\n# --- END OF CONFIGURATION ---\n\n\n# Construct the email message\nmessage = f\"Subject: {subject}\\n\\n{body}\"\n\n# Create a secure SSL context\ncontext = ssl.create_default_context()\nport = 465  # For SSL connection\n\nprint(\"Attempting to send email...\")\ntry:\n    # Connect to Gmail's SMTP server and send the email\n    with smtplib.SMTP_SSL(\"smtp.gmail.com\", port, context=context) as server:\n        server.login(sender_email, app_password)\n        server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, message)\n    print(\"Email sent successfully!\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n```\n\n### Step 3: Schedule the Script to Run\nThe script above sends an email immediately when it is run. To send it at a specific time, you use your operating system's built-in task scheduler.\n\n**To run the script, you'll need the full path to your Python interpreter and the script file.**\n\n#### On Windows (using Task Scheduler)\n1.  Open **Task Scheduler** from the Start Menu.\n2.  Click **Create Basic Task...** on the right pane.\n3.  Give it a name (e.g., \"Send Daily Report\").\n4.  Set the **Trigger** (e.g., Daily, at 9:00 AM).\n5.  For the **Action**, select **Start a program**.\n6.  In the \"Program/script\" box, enter the full path to your Python executable (e.g., `C:\\Python39\\python.exe`).\n7.  In the \"Add arguments (optional)\" box, enter the full path to your script (e.g., `C:\\Users\\YourUser\\Documents\\send_email.py`).\n8.  Finish the wizard.\n\n#### On macOS or Linux (using cron)\n1.  Open your terminal.\n2.  Type `crontab -e` to edit your scheduled tasks.\n3.  Add a new line at the bottom in this format:\n    `[minute] [hour] [day_of_month] [month] [day_of_week] [command_to_run]`\n\n    **Example:** To run the script every day at 8:30 AM:\n    ```\n    30 8 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/user/scripts/send_email.py\n    ```\n    *(Replace the path to `python3` and your script file with your actual paths.)*\n\n4.  Save and close the editor. The task is now scheduled."

Creating a backup script (for security and clarity).\n2.  Scheduling the script to run weekly using `cron`.\n\n#### Step 1: Create a Backup Script\n\nIt's best practice not to put your database password directly into the `cron` command. Instead, we'll use a configuration file and a small script.\n\n1.  **Create a MySQL Configuration File:**\n    Create a file named `~/.my.cnf` in the home directory of the user that will run the backup. This file will securely store the database credentials.\n    ```bash\n    # Create and open the file\n    nano ~/.my.cnf\n    ```\n    Add the following content, replacing `[username]` and `[your_password]` with your MySQL credentials:\n    ```ini\n    [mysqldump]\n    user = [username]\n    password = [your_password]\n    ```\n2.  **Secure the Configuration File:**\n    Set the permissions so only you can read and write to it.\n    ```bash\n    chmod 600 ~/.my.cnf\n    ```\n3.  **Create the Backup Script:**\n    Create a script file, for example, `/home/your_user/backup.sh`.\n    ```bash\n    # Create and open the script file\n    nano /home/your_user/backup.sh\n    ```\n    Add the following lines. This script will dump your database to a file with the current date in its name.\n    *   Replace `[database_name]` with the name of your database.\n    *   Replace `/path/to/backups/` with the directory where you want to store the exports.\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    \n    # Define database and backup path\n    DB_NAME=\"[database_name]\"\n    BACKUP_DIR=\"/path/to/backups/\"\n    \n    # Create a unique filename with a timestamp\n    FILENAME=\"${BACKUP_DIR}${DB_NAME}_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).sql\"\n    \n    # Run the backup command\n    mysqldump $DB_NAME > $FILENAME\n    ```\n4.  **Make the Script Executable:**\n    ```bash\n    chmod +x /home/your_user/backup.sh\n    ```\n\n#### Step 2: Schedule the Weekly Cron Job\n\n1.  **Open the Crontab Editor:**\n    This command opens an editor to add, view, or modify scheduled tasks.\n    ```bash\n    crontab -e\n    ```\n2.  **Add the Cron Job:**\n    Add the following line to the end of the file. This example schedules the script to run every Sunday at 2:00 AM.\n\n    `0 2 * * 0 /home/your_user/backup.sh`\n\n    *   `0 2 * * 0`: This is the schedule. It means: at minute `0`, of hour `2`, on any day-of-month, in any month, on `Sunday` (0).\n    *   `/home/your_user/backup.sh`: This is the full path to the script you created.\n\n3.  **Save and Exit:**\n    Save the file and close the editor. The cron job is now active and will run automatically at the scheduled time."

The user is a beginner who wants an overview of investment types and their risks for diversification.\n\n**Summary:** You are a beginner looking for a basic overview of different investment types and their risks to understand how to diversify a portfolio.\n\nHere is a beginner-friendly overview of common investment types:\n\n### What is Diversification?\nThe core idea is \"don't put all your eggs in one basket.\" By spreading your money across different types of investments (called asset classes), you reduce the risk that a poor performance in one investment will significantly harm your overall portfolio.\n\n---\n\n### Common Investment Types & Their Risks\n\n**1. Stocks (also called Equities)**\n*   **What they are:** A share of ownership in a public company (e.g., Apple, Amazon). You make money if the company does well and its stock price increases, or through payments called dividends.\n*   **Risk Level:** **High.** Stock prices can be volatile, meaning they can rise or fall quickly. You could earn high returns, but you could also lose your entire investment.\n*   **Role in a portfolio:** Primary engine for long-term growth.\n\n**2. Bonds (also called Fixed Income)**\n*   **What they are:** You are essentially lending money to a government or a company. In return, they promise to pay you back the full amount on a specific date, plus regular interest payments along the way.\n*   **Risk Level:** **Low to Medium.** Generally safer than stocks. The main risks are the issuer failing to pay you back (credit risk) or rising interest rates making your existing, lower-rate bond less valuable (interest rate risk).\n*   **Role in a portfolio:** To provide stability and income, balancing out the volatility of stocks.\n\n**3. Cash and Cash Equivalents**\n*   **What they are:** This includes money in high-yield savings accounts, money market funds, or short-term government debt. It's easily accessible.\n*   **Risk Level:** **Very Low.** Your money is safe and unlikely to decrease in value. However, its returns are also very low and may not keep up with inflation, meaning your money loses purchasing power over time.\n*   **Role in a portfolio:** For safety, emergencies, or short-term goals.\n\n**4. Real Estate**\n*   **What they are:** Investing in physical property (like a rental home) or through Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), which are companies that own and operate properties and trade on the stock market.\n*   **Risk Level:** **Medium to High.** Can provide rental income and value appreciation. However, physical property is illiquid (hard to sell quickly) and requires management. REITs are more liquid but are subject to stock market volatility.\n*   **Role in a portfolio:** A way to diversify away from traditional stocks and bonds, potentially earning both income and growth.\n\n---\n\n### Simple Next Step for a Beginner\n\nA common starting point is to invest in a **low-cost, diversified index fund or ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund)**. These funds automatically hold hundreds or thousands of stocks or bonds, giving you instant diversification without needing to pick individual investments yourself. For example, an S&P 500 index fund invests in the 500 largest companies in the U.S."

      "content": "Clarity Check: CLEAR. Based on the conversation history, the user is a beginner who wants to understand diversification by seeing examples of how to construct a sample portfolio with specific percentage allocations.\n\n**Summary:** You are a beginner looking for sample portfolios to understand how asset allocation (the percentage mix of stocks, bonds, etc.) works for diversification.\n\nHere are some common sample portfolios, often called \"model portfolios,\" that show how you can mix investments based on your goals and risk tolerance.\n\n---\n\n### The Two Key Factors: Time & Risk\n\nThe right mix for you depends mainly on two things:\n\n1.  **Time Horizon:** How long until you need the money? A longer timeline (10+ years) allows you to take more risks for higher potential growth.\n2.  **Risk Tolerance:** How comfortable are you with your portfolio's value going up and down?\n\nBelow are three classic examples. For simplicity, they only use two main asset classes: Stocks (for growth) and Bonds (for stability).\n\n---\n\n### Sample Portfolios for Different Risk Levels\n\n**1. The Conservative Portfolio**\n*   **Allocation:** 40% Stocks / 60% Bonds\n*   **Who it's for:** Someone with a low risk tolerance or a short time horizon (e.g., nearing retirement).\n*   **Goal:** The primary goal is to preserve capital and generate some income, with less emphasis on high growth. This portfolio will be much more stable than one heavy in stocks but will also have lower long-term returns.\n\n**2. The Moderate (or \"Balanced\") Portfolio**\n*   **Allocation:** 60% Stocks / 40% Bonds\n*   **Who it's for:** This is a classic, middle-of-the-road approach suitable for many investors with a medium-to-long time horizon.\n*   **Goal:** To achieve a balance between long-term growth from stocks and stability from bonds. It's designed to capture a good portion of stock market gains while softening the blow during downturns.\n\n**3. The Aggressive Portfolio**\n*   **Allocation:** 80% Stocks / 20% Bonds\n*   **Who it's for:** A younger investor with a long time horizon (e.g., 20+ years until retirement) and a high tolerance for risk.\n*   **Goal:** To maximize long-term growth. This portfolio has the highest potential for returns but will also experience the most significant ups and downs (volatility). The long time horizon gives the portfolio ample time to recover from market downturns.\n\n---\n\n### Easy Way for Beginners to Implement This\n\nYou don't need to buy dozens of individual stocks and bonds to build these portfolios. The easiest way is to use a single, pre-mixed fund.\n\n*   **Target-Date Funds:** You pick a fund with your estimated retirement year in the name (e.g., \"Target-Date 2060 Fund\"). It starts with an aggressive allocation and automatically becomes more conservative as you get closer to that date.\n*   **All-in-One / Asset Allocation ETFs:** You pick a single fund based on a risk profile (e.g., a \"Balanced ETF\" or \"Growth ETF\"). This fund holds a fixed mix of stocks and bonds (like 60/40) and automatically rebalances to maintain it.\n\nThese \"set it and forget it\" funds are an excellent way for beginners to get a diversified portfolio that matches their goals without any complex management."

You can do them individually or together as a sequence.\n\n---\n\n### **A Balanced Routine for Work Breaks**\n\n**1. To Calm Your Mind: Box Breathing (1 Minute)**\nThis technique quiets an anxious mind and regulates your nervous system. It's discreet and can be done anywhere.\n\n*   **Step 1:** Inhale slowly through your nose for a count of 4.\n*   **Step 2:** Hold your breath for a count of 4.\n*   **Step 3:** Exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of 4.\n*   **Step 4:** Hold at the bottom of the exhale for a count of 4.\n*   Repeat this cycle 4-5 times.\n\n**2. To Release Physical Tension: Seated Stretches (2 Minutes)**\nThese target the neck, shoulders, and back—common tension spots from sitting.\n\n*   **Neck Roll (30 seconds per side):** Gently drop your chin to your chest. Slowly roll your right ear toward your right shoulder and hold for 15-20 seconds. Return to center and repeat on the left side.\n*   **Shoulder Shrugs & Rolls (1 minute):** Inhale and lift your shoulders up toward your ears, hold for 3 seconds, then exhale and release them down. Repeat 3 times. Follow this by slowly rolling your shoulders backward in a circle 5 times, then forward 5 times.\n\n**3. To Boost Energy & Focus: Dynamic Movement (2 Minutes)**\nThis gets your blood flowing to combat mental fatigue without making you sweat.\n\n*   **Option A (Lower Intensity): Torso Twists.** While seated or standing, place your hands on your shoulders. Gently twist your upper body from side to side for 30 seconds.\n*   **Option B (Higher Intensity): Desk Plank.** Place your forearms on your desk, step your feet back until your body forms a straight line from head to heels. Engage your core and hold for 30-60 seconds. This activates major muscle groups and increases alertness."

I can provide a step-by-step guide to check the most common causes.\n\n**Summary of Your Goal:** You want to diagnose and fix a buzzing or humming sound coming from your refrigerator, and you're ready to investigate the most likely locations.\n\nHere is a diagnostic plan to identify and fix the issue. The two most common culprits for a buzzing sound are the evaporator fan and the condenser fan.\n\n**Safety First: Always unplug your refrigerator from the wall outlet before you begin any inspection or repair.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Diagnostic Plan**\n\n#### **1. Check the Evaporator Fan (Inside the Freezer)**\n\nThis fan circulates cold air inside your fridge and freezer.\n\n*   **How to Diagnose:**\n    1.  With the fridge still plugged in, open the freezer door. Most evaporator fans stop when the door is opened.\n    2.  If the buzzing stops the moment you open the door, the evaporator fan is almost certainly the cause.\n    3.  If the noise continues, locate the small switch or button inside the door frame that the door presses when closed. Press it manually. If the noise starts, you've confirmed it's the evaporator fan.\n*   **How to Fix:**\n    1.  **Unplug the refrigerator.**\n    2.  Empty the freezer and locate the panel at the back. Remove the screws holding it in place.\n    3.  Check for ice buildup obstructing the fan blades. If you see significant ice, your defrost system may be failing. A complete manual defrost (leaving the fridge unplugged and open for 24 hours) will solve it temporarily.\n    4.  If there's no ice, the fan motor itself may be failing. It will need to be replaced.\n\n#### **2. Check the Condenser Fan (At the Back/Bottom)**\n\nThis fan cools the compressor and condenser coils.\n\n*   **How to Diagnose & Fix:**\n    1.  **Unplug the refrigerator** and pull it away from the wall.\n    2.  Locate the thin service panel on the back near the bottom (usually cardboard or thin metal) and remove it.\n    3.  The condenser fan is a small fan near the large, black compressor. Check if it's blocked by dust, debris, or loose wires.\n    4.  Clean the fan blades and the surrounding area thoroughly with a vacuum and a soft brush. Often, a simple cleaning resolves the noise.\n    5.  If the fan is clean but still noisy when power is restored (or doesn't spin freely when moved by hand), the motor is likely worn out and needs to be replaced.\n\n---\n\n**If Neither Fan is the Problem:**\n\n*   **The Compressor:** A low, steady hum from the black, tank-like compressor is normal. However, if it emits a loud, intermittent, or constant buzz, it may be failing. This is a complex and expensive repair that typically requires a professional technician.\n\nIf you complete these steps and can't find the source, or if you're not comfortable replacing a motor, it's best to call a qualified appliance repair technician."
