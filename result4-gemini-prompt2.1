These bags are designed to withstand abuse while protecting your gear.\n\nHere are the best options in this category:\n\n**1. Patagonia Black Hole® Duffel (90L or 120L)**\n*   **Why it's a great choice:** This is an industry standard for a reason. It's made from a thick, TPU-laminated polyester ripstop that is extremely durable and highly water-resistant. The padded backpack straps make it comfortable to carry over short distances, and multiple grab handles make it easy to haul.\n*   **Best for:** All-around expedition use where maximum durability and high water resistance are key.\n\n**2. The North Face Base Camp Duffel (L or XL)**\n*   **Why it's a great choice:** A direct competitor to the Black Hole, the Base Camp Duffel is renowned for its \"bombproof\" construction using a rugged ballistic nylon fabric. It features a D-zip opening for easy access to the main compartment and comfortable, detachable shoulder straps.\n*   **Best for:** Users who prioritize legendary toughness and a proven track record in the harshest environments.\n\n**3. Osprey Transporter® Wheeled Duffel (90L or 120L)**\n*   **Why it's a great choice:** This bag combines the rugged, water-resistant fabric of an expedition duffel with a HighRoad™ chassis featuring large, sturdy wheels. This makes it far easier to navigate airports and smoother surfaces without sacrificing the durability needed for remote transport.\n*   **Best for:** Expeditions that involve significant airport travel before heading to rugged locations.\n\nFor your use case, a capacity of 90 liters or more is generally recommended to accommodate the large amount of gear required for an expedition. All three options offer excellent protection and durability for your adventures."

Based on your input, you need a list of essential home office tech for technical work like software development or data analysis.\n\nHere is a tailored list of essential tech equipment for a productive technical home office:\n\n### Core Setup: The Foundation\n*   **Powerful Computer (Laptop or Desktop):** This is your primary tool. Prioritize a strong CPU (e.g., Intel Core i7/i9, AMD Ryzen 7/9) and ample RAM (16GB minimum, 32GB+ recommended) to handle compiling code, running local servers, virtual machines, or processing large datasets without slowdowns.\n*   **Dual High-Resolution Monitors:** A multi-monitor setup is crucial for productivity. It allows you to have your code editor on one screen and documentation, terminal, or application output on the other. Aim for at least one 27-inch 1440p (QHD) or 4K monitor for sharp text and generous screen real estate.\n\n### Ergonomics & Comfort\n*   **Mechanical Keyboard:** Many developers prefer mechanical keyboards for their durability and superior tactile feedback, leading to a more comfortable and accurate typing experience during long coding sessions.\n*   **Ergonomic Chair & Mouse:** You'll be sitting for long hours. A quality ergonomic chair and a comfortable mouse are non-negotiable investments to prevent back pain and repetitive strain injury (RSI).\n\n### Connectivity & Peripherals\n*   **Docking Station or USB-C Hub:** If you use a laptop, a dock is essential. It lets you connect to your monitors, keyboard, mouse, and other peripherals with a single cable, making it easy to transition between a mobile and desk setup.\n*   **Reliable High-Speed Internet (Wired Connection):** Stable internet is critical for version control (Git), accessing cloud services, and video calls. Use a wired Ethernet connection instead of Wi-Fi whenever possible for maximum stability and speed.\n*   **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply):** This battery backup protects your machine from sudden power outages, preventing data loss and file corruption. It's a lifesaver if you're in the middle of a long-running process or haven't saved your work.\n*   **Backup Solution (External SSD or Cloud Service):** Regularly back up your code and important files. A fast external SSD or an automated cloud backup service (like Backblaze) provides peace of mind."

It will fetch the headlines from the BBC News homepage and save them to a file named `bbc_headlines.txt`.\n\n### **Action Plan**\n\n**1. Prerequisites:**\nEnsure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries by running this command in your terminal:\n```bash\npip install requests beautifulsoup4\n```\n\n**2. Python Script:**\nSave the following code as a Python file (e.g., `get_headlines.py`):\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport datetime\n\n# URL for the BBC News international homepage\nURL = \"https://www.bbc.com/news\"\n# File to save the headlines\nOUTPUT_FILE = \"bbc_headlines.txt\"\n\ntry:\n    # Fetch the content from the URL\n    response = requests.get(URL)\n    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes\n\n    # Parse the HTML content\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n\n    # Find all headline elements. BBC often uses h3 tags for headlines.\n    # The class name can change, so we look for a common pattern.\n    headlines = soup.find_all('h3', class_='gs-c-promo-heading__title')\n\n    if not headlines:\n        print(\"Could not find headlines. The website structure may have changed.\")\n        # As a fallback, try finding all h3 tags, a less specific but broader search\n        headlines = soup.find_all('h3')\n\n    with open(OUTPUT_FILE, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n        f.write(f\"BBC News Headlines - Fetched on {timestamp}\\n\")\n        f.write(\"=\"*40 + \"\\n\\n\")\n        \n        count = 0\n        for headline in headlines:\n            # Get the text and strip any leading/trailing whitespace\n            headline_text = headline.get_text(strip=True)\n            if headline_text:\n                f.write(f\"- {headline_text}\\n\")\n                count += 1\n        \n        print(f\"Successfully saved {count} headlines to {OUTPUT_FILE}\")\n\nexcept requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n    print(f\"Error fetching the URL: {e}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n```\n\n**3. How to Run:**\n1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.\n2.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the `get_headlines.py` file.\n3.  Run the script with the command:\n    ```bash\n    python get_headlines.py\n    ```\n\nAfter running, a file named `bbc_headlines.txt` will be created in the same directory, containing the latest headlines."

Appetizer: Bruschetta with Balsamic Glaze**\n\n*   **Why it works:** It's light, fresh, and requires minimal cooking, letting you focus on the main course.\n*   **Ingredients:** 1 baguette, 2 ripe tomatoes, 1 clove garlic, fresh basil, olive oil, salt, pepper, balsamic glaze.\n*   **Recipe:**\n    1.  Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Slice the baguette into ½-inch thick rounds.\n    2.  Place slices on a baking sheet, brush lightly with olive oil, and bake for 5-7 minutes until golden and crisp. Rub one side of each toast with the raw garlic clove.\n    3.  Dice tomatoes and finely chop basil. Combine in a bowl with 1 tbsp olive oil, salt, and pepper.\n    4.  Top each toast with the tomato mixture and drizzle with balsamic glaze just before serving.\n\n**2. Main Course: Creamy Tuscan Chicken**\n\n*   **Why it works:** A rich, restaurant-quality dish that is surprisingly straightforward to make in one pan.\n*   **Ingredients:** 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, 1 tbsp olive oil, 2 cloves garlic (minced), ½ cup sun-dried tomatoes (chopped), 1 cup heavy cream, ½ cup chicken broth, ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, 2 cups fresh spinach, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.\n*   **Recipe:**\n    1.  Season chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.\n    2.  Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken for 5-7 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through. Remove chicken and set aside.\n    3.  In the same skillet, add minced garlic and sun-dried tomatoes. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n    4.  Pour in the chicken broth to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits. Stir in the heavy cream and bring to a simmer.\n    5.  Add Parmesan cheese and stir until the sauce thickens. Add the spinach and cook until it wilts. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.\n    6.  Return the chicken to the skillet, spooning the sauce over it. Serve immediately over pasta or with crusty bread.\n\n**3. Dessert: Molten Chocolate Lava Cakes**\n\n*   **Why it works:** This dessert is decadent, personal-sized, and has a wonderful \"wow\" factor when the chocolate center flows out.\n*   **Ingredients:** 4 oz bittersweet chocolate (chopped), ½ stick (4 tbsp) unsalted butter, 1 large egg + 1 egg yolk, 2 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp all-purpose flour, pinch of salt.\n*   **Recipe:**\n    1.  Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Grease and flour two small ramekins.\n    2.  Melt chocolate and butter together in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring until smooth.\n    3.  In a separate bowl, whisk the egg, egg yolk, and sugar until pale and slightly fluffy (about 2 minutes).\n    4.  Gently fold the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture. Fold in the flour and salt until just combined.\n    5.  Pour batter evenly into the prepared ramekins. Bake for 12-14 minutes, until the sides are firm but the center is still soft.\n    6.  Let cool for 1 minute, then carefully run a knife around the edge and invert onto plates. Serve immediately, perhaps with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or fresh raspberries."

Knit midi dresses in a solid color are also a sophisticated and comfortable option.\n3.  **Structured Trousers & Skirts:**\n    *   **Trend:** High-waisted, straight-leg or wide-leg trousers in fabrics like wool or twill offer a contemporary silhouette. For skirts, a leather or suede pencil or A-line skirt in a midi length is a modern classic.\n4.  **Key Accessories:**\n    *   **Footwear:** Classic leather loafers, elegant block heels, or pointed-toe flats.\n    *   **Bag:** A structured leather tote bag without large logos.\n\n#### **For a Menswear Wardrobe:**\n\n1.  **The Deconstructed Suit:** Focus on softer tailoring and separates.\n    *   **Trend:** Suits with less padding in the shoulders and a more natural drape. Also, consider breaking up suits—wear the blazer with different tailored trousers.\n    *   **Fabric:** Look for textures like flannel, tweed, or subtle plaids (like a Prince of Wales check).\n2.  **High-Quality Knitwear:** Replace the dress shirt occasionally.\n    *   **Trend:** A fine-gauge merino wool or cashmere sweater (crewneck or V-neck) worn under a sport coat or blazer provides a sharp, modern European look.\n3.  **Smart Trousers:** Invest in trousers separate from your suits.\n    *   **Trend:** Well-fitting trousers in wool, cotton twill, or flannel in shades of grey, navy, and brown. A clean, flat-front cut with a slight taper is most current.\n4.  **Updated Footwear:**\n    *   **Trend:** High-quality leather is key. Double monk strap shoes are a stylish alternative to oxfords, and polished leather loafers (worn with socks) work well for a slightly less formal day."

      "content": "Based on the dialogue so far, the task **can be solved now**.\n\nHere are updated clothing trend recommendations specifically for a corporate menswear wardrobe, suitable for finance, law, or consulting.\n\nThe key trend for modern corporate menswear is \"soft tailoring.\" This involves moving away from rigid, heavily-structured suits towards more comfortable fits, versatile separates, and high-quality fabrics that convey professionalism without being overly formal.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for a Corporate Menswear Wardrobe**\n\nHere are five key areas to focus on for updating your professional look:\n\n**1. The Modern Suit & Blazer:**\n*   **Trend:** Look for suits with a \"deconstructed\" or \"unstructured\" blazer. This means less shoulder padding and a softer, more natural silhouette. Double-breasted blazers are a stylish, contemporary choice.\n*   **Fabric & Color:** Beyond standard navy and charcoal, consider suits and blazers in textured fabrics like flannel, hopsack, or a subtle birdseye pattern. Colors like chocolate brown, deep olive, and muted greys are modern yet professional.\n*   **Example:** Wear a Prince of Wales check blazer with solid charcoal wool trousers.\n\n**2. The Rise of Knitwear:**\n*   **Trend:** Layering with fine-gauge knitwear is the sharpest way to update your look. It can often replace a traditional dress shirt and tie under a blazer.\n*   **Key Items:** Invest in merino wool or cashmere crewneck sweaters and long-sleeve knit polos.\n*   **How to Wear It:** A navy knit polo under a grey suit jacket, or a charcoal crewneck sweater over a white dress shirt (no tie) with a blazer.\n\n**3. The Updated Trouser:**\n*   **Trend:** The fit is relaxing from the ultra-slim look. A straight-leg or gently tapered cut is current. Single pleats are back and offer more comfort and a sophisticated drape.\n*   **Key Items:** Build a collection of high-quality standalone trousers in wool, flannel, and cotton twill.\n*   **Colors:** Essential colors are charcoal grey, mid-grey, navy, and brown.\n\n**4. Refined Footwear:**\n*   **Trend:** Quality and versatility are key.\n*   **Styles:**\n    *   **Double Monk Straps:** A stylish and confident alternative to the standard Oxford.\n    *   **High-Quality Loafers:** Polished leather tassel or penny loafers (always worn with dress socks in a corporate setting) are excellent.\n    *   **Color:** A dark brown or deep burgundy (oxblood) shoe is often more versatile than black.\n\n**5. Textured Accessories:**\n*   **Trend:** Add visual interest with texture rather than bright colors.\n*   **Ties:** If wearing a tie, choose one with texture, like a grenadine, knit, or wool tie. The width should be classic, not skinny.\n*   **Briefcase:** A minimalist leather briefcase or folio with no prominent logos."

Its combination of a sublime Tchaikovsky score, a timeless story of love and tragedy, and the technically demanding dual role of Odette/Odile has cemented its place as a global cultural phenomenon and a staple for every major ballet company.\n\n2.  **Giselle (1841):** The pinnacle of the Romantic ballet era. It is celebrated for its historical importance and the dramatic depth required for the lead role. The \"white act\" (Act II) is legendary and represents the epitome of ethereal, romantic choreography that influenced the art form for generations.\n\n3.  **The Rite of Spring (1913):** A revolutionary performance that marked the birth of modern dance. Its dissonant Stravinsky score and avant-garde Nijinsky choreography famously caused a riot at its Paris premiere. It is renowned for its monumental impact on both music and dance, breaking from classical tradition and paving the way for 20th-century modernism."

The Program Code (`calculator.py`)\n\nFirst, here is the simple program based on your description. Save this in a file named `calculator.py`.\n\n```python\n# calculator.py\n\ndef add(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Returns the sum of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return a + b\n\ndef subtract(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Returns the difference of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return a - b\n\ndef multiply(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Returns the product of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    return a * b\n\ndef divide(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Returns the quotient of two numbers. Raises ValueError for division by zero.\"\"\"\n    if b == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    return a / b\n```\n\n### 2. The Unit Test Code (`test_calculator.py`)\n\nNow, save the following code in a file named `test_calculator.py` in the **same directory**.\n\n```python\n# test_calculator.py\n\nimport unittest\nfrom calculator import add, subtract, multiply, divide\n\nclass TestCalculator(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def test_add(self):\n        \"\"\"Test the add function\"\"\"\n        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)\n        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)\n        self.assertEqual(add(-5, -5), -10)\n\n    def test_subtract(self):\n        \"\"\"Test the subtract function\"\"\"\n        self.assertEqual(subtract(10, 5), 5)\n        self.assertEqual(subtract(-1, 1), -2)\n        self.assertEqual(subtract(-1, -1), 0)\n\n    def test_multiply(self):\n        \"\"\"Test the multiply function\"\"\"\n        self.assertEqual(multiply(3, 7), 21)\n        self.assertEqual(multiply(-1, 1), -1)\n        self.assertEqual(multiply(-1, -1), 1)\n        self.assertEqual(multiply(5, 0), 0)\n\n    def test_divide(self):\n        \"\"\"Test the divide function\"\"\"\n        self.assertEqual(divide(10, 2), 5)\n        self.assertEqual(divide(-1, 1), -1)\n        self.assertEqual(divide(-1, -1), 1)\n        self.assertEqual(divide(5, 2), 2.5)\n\n    def test_divide_by_zero(self):\n        \"\"\"Test that division by zero raises a ValueError\"\"\"\n        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):\n            divide(10, 0)\n\n# This allows running the tests directly from the command line\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n### How to Run the Tests\n\n1.  Make sure you have both `calculator.py` and `test_calculator.py` in the same folder.\n2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.\n3.  Navigate to that folder.\n4.  Run the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    python -m unittest test_calculator.py\n    ```\n\nYou should see output indicating that all 5 tests passed successfully."

Video Tutorial: \"How to Knit a Scarf for Absolute Beginners\" by Sheep & Stitch**\nThis YouTube tutorial is clear, slow-paced, and designed for someone who has never held knitting needles.\n\n*   **Link:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_AyMMj4sfg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_AyMMj4sfg)\n*   **Why it's good for beginners:** It visually demonstrates every step, from making the first slip knot to weaving in the ends. You can easily pause and re-watch sections.\n\n**2. Written Tutorial: \"Garter Stitch Scarf\" by Purl Soho**\nThis is a classic, beautifully photographed guide that is very easy to follow.\n\n*   **Link:** [https://www.purlsoho.com/create/2011/01/05/whos-ready-to-knit-a-garter-stitch-scarf/](https://www.purlsoho.com/create/2011/01/05/whos-ready-to-knit-a-garter-stitch-scarf/)\n*   **Why it's good for beginners:** The high-quality photos clearly show each step. It's perfect for checking your work against a finished example.\n\n### **Materials You'll Need:**\nBoth tutorials use similar materials. For a beginner, \"chunky\" or \"bulky\" weight yarn and appropriately sized needles are recommended because they work up faster and make stitches easier to see.\n*   **Yarn:** 1-2 skeins of Bulky weight yarn (Weight #5).\n*   **Knitting Needles:** Size 10 or 11 US (6-8 mm).\n*   **Accessories:** A pair of scissors and a tapestry needle (for weaving in the ends)."
